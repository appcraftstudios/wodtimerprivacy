# Privacy Policy - WodTimer

## 1. Our Commitment to Your Privacy

Welcome to WodTimer. This Privacy Policy has been created to provide you with a clear and comprehensive understanding of how we handle your information.

Our guiding principle is that **your data is yours**. WodTimer is fundamentally designed as a privacy-first application. We have architected our service so that we do not have access to your personal information. All data processing, including timer configurations, workout history, and preferences, is performed exclusively on your device. We operate with **zero servers and zero tracking**.

## 2. Information We Access (With Your Permission)

To provide its features, WodTimer requests your permission to access the following information on your device. This access is strictly for the purposes described below, and this data is never transmitted to us or any third party.

- **HealthKit Data (Optional):** If you choose to enable HealthKit integration, we request permission to write workout data to your Health app. This allows the app to log your completed workouts for your personal fitness tracking.
- **Notifications:** We request permission to send local notifications to alert you about timer phases, round completions, and workout transitions.

## 3. Information We DO NOT Collect

WodTimer does **not** collect, store, transmit, or have access to any of the following data:

- **Personal Identifiers:** Your name, email address, location, or any other personally identifiable information.
- **Workout Data:** Any details about your workouts, including timer configurations, workout history, favorites, or personal records.
- **Device Usage:** We do not track which timer modes you use, how long you train, or any other usage patterns.
- **Analytics and Usage Data:** The app contains no third-party or proprietary analytics trackers. We do not monitor how you use the app.

## 4. How Your Data is Processed On-Device

The core functionality of WodTimer relies on processing your data securely and locally on your device.

- **Local Storage:** All timer presets, favorites, workout history, and preferences are stored exclusively on your device using standard iOS secure storage mechanisms.
- **Apple Watch Sync:** When you use WodTimer with your Apple Watch, timer data is synchronized between your devices using Apple's WatchConnectivity framework. This communication happens directly between your paired devices and does not pass through our servers.
- **iCloud Sync (If Enabled):** If you enable iCloud sync in your iOS settings, your timer configurations and preferences may be synchronized across your Apple devices using your personal iCloud account. This is handled entirely by Apple's iCloud infrastructure, and we do not have access to this data.

## 5. Data Security Measures

We employ robust security measures to protect the data stored by WodTimer on your device.

- **Secure Storage:** All app data is stored using iOS's secure app sandbox, which prevents other apps from accessing your WodTimer data.
- **No External Transmission:** Your workout data never leaves your device except through Apple's secure iCloud sync (if you have enabled it in your device settings).

## 6. Third-Party Integrations

WodTimer uses third-party services to enable certain features. Our integration with these services is designed to maintain your privacy.

- **Apple App Store:** If you choose to subscribe to WodTimer Premium, all transactions are processed securely by Apple's in-app purchase system. We do not collect or have access to your payment information.
- **Google Mobile Ads (iOS only):** The free version of WodTimer displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob. Google may collect certain information to serve personalized ads according to their privacy policy. You can review Google's privacy practices at https://policies.google.com/privacy. Premium subscribers do not see advertisements.

## 7. Data Retention

As we do not collect your personal data on our servers, we do not have a data retention policy for such data. All data generated by the app, such as timer configurations and workout history, is stored on your device until you either delete it from within the app or uninstall the app.

## 8. Your Privacy Rights and Controls

You are in full control of your data when using WodTimer.

- **Permission Control:** You can grant or revoke access to notifications and HealthKit at any time through the iOS Settings app.
- **Data Deletion:** You can clear your timer favorites and reset preferences within the app's settings. Deleting the app from your device will remove all of its locally stored data.
- **Ad Preferences:** You can control personalized advertising through your iOS settings under Privacy > Tracking.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make material changes, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of this policy and providing a notice within the app.
